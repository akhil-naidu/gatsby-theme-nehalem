In a speech to the nation tonight, Prime Minister Narendra Modi enlightened us with the 5 Pillars and announced an economic package to tackle the downside of the corona-virus crisis.

The PM in his speech at 8 pm highlighted that India must realise its potential as the lead player in the 21st century by focusing on its self-reliance.

### **The 5 pillars for Self-Reliance:**

* Economy with potential for quantum jump
* Infrastructure
* Tech-driven system
* Demography
* Intelligence-driven supply system



An economic package of Rs 20 lakh crore, amounting to 10% of GDP, will help India realise its full potential, he said. 

### **The package is to be factored on:**

* Land
* Labour
* Liquidity and 
* Law 

These 4L's will promote Make In India even while rescuing MSMEs, farmers and others, he said.
