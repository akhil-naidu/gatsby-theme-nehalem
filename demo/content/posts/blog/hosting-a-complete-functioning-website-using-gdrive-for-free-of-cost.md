Did you know that you can use Google Drive to host a variety of different websites varying from basic websites to even complex javascript we apps? If not, let take advantage of Google Drive’s free storage to upload and publish any kind of static content to host a website or host your personal collections online.

## Small information for better understating of this.

A simple definition of “hosting” for people who are new to this. Hosting means storing files/software in a place where everyone can access it. Those files can vary from simple code - complex algorithms or even a collection of pictures. As you already know Google is also proving us an option to store or share files personally and publically, which in a way has the capability of hosting a website.

### Advantages

* Replacing files in G Drive will update your website

### Disadvantages

* If you want to replace your previous website which is from WordPress or Joomla or any PHP based websites, this will not work for you.
* This is only for static websites, ie, content remains constant

### How can use it at your advantage
