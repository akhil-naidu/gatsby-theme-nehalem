## Anthony Fauci's comment on 25th March 2020

What we're starting to see now in the southern hemisphere in southern Africa and in the southern hemisphere countries is that we're having cases that are appearing as they go into their winter season. In fact, if they have a substantial outbreak, It will be inevitable that we need to be prepared that we'll get a cycle around the second time.

What does that mean for us? In what we're doing it totally emphasizes the need to do what we're doing in developing a vaccine, testing it quickly and trying to get it ready. So they will have a vaccine available for that next cycle.

In addition, doing the randomized controlled trials of drugs. So that we will have a menu of drugs that we have shown to be effective and shown to be safe because I know we'll be successful in putting this down now. But we really need to be prepared for another cycle and what we're doing I believe will prepare us well.
