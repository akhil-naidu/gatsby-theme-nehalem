title: I'm Akhil
path: /author/akhil
excerpt: I am Akhil Naidu Kaparapu
---
I am an Engineering Physics graduate from IIT Guwahati, but merely not restricted to Physics itself. In the past few years, I involved in many open-source projects, mainly through contribution, that too, especially in the field of writing guides for beginners to start their projects.\
\
I'm also interested in Network and Security and continuously staying up to date with the latest security flaws that have been identified. Testing and using these exploits to launch a successful attack and noting down the precautionary measures through blogs is one of my hobbies.\
\
Previously I wrote blogs and contributed my content in Haklab, OurConfig, CLG Life, Hacking Episodes, Personal Quora Blog and presently trying to make an environment for the Programmers and Ethical Hackers through Leewardslope
